      <h1>Make A Burger</h1>
      <p>
        Burgers are one of the most beloved fast foods in the world. Made with a
        juicy patty—usually beef, chicken, or a plant-based alternative—tucked
        between two soft buns, burgers are a delicious combination of flavor,
        texture, and satisfaction. What makes them special is their versatility:
        you can customize them with cheese, fresh vegetables, sauces, and even
        eggs or bacon to match your taste.
